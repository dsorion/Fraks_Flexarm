# FRAKS Flexarm

### Free Range Arm Kinematics System

The Fraks Flexarm is a tool-balancing arm designed to keep the attached tool parallel throughout its movement. It was created to hold soldering irons to install heat set inserts into 3D printed parts.

It has a large working area for its size, and has quick release tool holders that are held in place with magnets.

Thanks to Zack Freedman for making Gridfinity an open source project, I have included Gridfinity storage into the base. You can read more about Gridfinity at <https://gridfinity.xyz/>

# What do I need?

* You will also need either pocket screws or a wood working fence clamp to secure the base to your work surface.

* 4 pieces of 1515 extrusion, all cut to the same length and tapped on either end. I have tested this with 200mm and 270mm lengths.

* 10x1x60mm extension springs, these seem to work well for 200-300mm builds. You can adjust the tension rate by moving the spring posts along the 1515 extrusion.

* 10x100mm dowel pin and a 10x14x30mm brass Bushing

* M10 washer, a 25mm diameter is listed, but any diameter and thickness washer will work.

* M5x30 FHCS are recommended, but BHCS are also supported. The springs will touch button heads slightly, but will not affect performance from testing.

* You will need a Soldering iron with a heatset insert adapter. I personally recommend either the Pinecil or TS101 Soldering Irons along with the adapter set from CNC Kitchen.

# Print Settings

* 0.2mm layer heights

* 0.4mm Line Width

* 4-5 walls

* 4-5 top and bottom layers

* 40% infill

* ABS and ASA have been tested

# Assembly Tips

___

* The center arms use a pair of magnets to pull the arms together when parked. Build 2 arms with magnets that that attract to each other.

![Arm_Hardware_01](Images/Arm_Hardware_01.png)

* Build the other 2 arms like the image bellow, with the spring standoffs placed 90mm from one end. You can adjust these later.

# Change Log

November 2nd, 2025:

* Increased the thickness of the guard by 0.8mm, this should solve the issue that some users have had with breaking the guard.

* Doublde the BOM Count for the 6x2 Magnets used for Gridfinity, as to include enough for the trays as well as the base.

* Added a short readme about the 695 Bearing mod under the stl directory for them.
